PyMS was originally stored on googlecode, and moved to github when google code closed. The same group - Metabolomics Australia at the Bio21 Institute, University of Melbourne, manages the github repo. For any further information on the history of PyMS please email the maintainer: Sean O'Callaghan, spoc@unimelb.edu.au.

The main PyMS documentation is available here: https://github.com/ma-bio21/pyms-docs
