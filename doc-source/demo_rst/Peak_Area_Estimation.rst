Peak Area Estimation
====================

The :class:`~pyms.Peak.Class.Peak` object does not contain any information about the width or
area of the peak when it is first created. This information can be added
after the instantiation of a Peak object. The area of the peak can be
set with the attribute :attr:`~pyms.Peak.Class.Peak.area`.

The total peak area can by obtained by the :meth:`peak_sum_area() <pyms.Peak.Function.peak_sum_area>` function
in :mod:`pyms.Peak.Function`. The function determines the total area as the
sum of the ion intensities for all masses that apex at the given peak.
To calculate the peak area of a single mass, the intensities are added
from the apex of the mass peak outwards.

Edge values are added until the following conditions are met: \* the
added intensity adds less than 0.5% to the accumulated area; or \* the
added intensity starts increasing (i.e.Â when the ion is common to
co-eluting compounds).

To avoid noise effects, the edge value is taken at the midpoint of three
consecutive edge values.

First, build the Peak list as before

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 1

    import pathlib
    data_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve().parent.parent / "pyms-data"
    # Change this if the data files are stored in a different location

    output_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve() / "output"

    from pyms.GCMS.IO.JCAMP import JCAMP_reader
    from pyms.IntensityMatrix import build_intensity_matrix
    from pyms.Noise.SavitzkyGolay import savitzky_golay
    from pyms.TopHat import tophat
    from pyms.BillerBiemann import BillerBiemann

    jcamp_file = data_directory / "gc01_0812_066.jdx"
    data = JCAMP_reader(jcamp_file)
    im = build_intensity_matrix(data)

    n_scan, n_mz = im.size

    for ii in range(n_mz):
        ic = im.get_ic_at_index(ii)
        ic_smooth = savitzky_golay(ic)
        ic_bc = tophat(ic_smooth, struct="1.5m")
        im.set_ic_at_index(ii, ic_bc)

    peak_list = BillerBiemann(im, points=9, scans=2)

    from pyms.Noise.Analysis import window_analyzer
    tic = data.tic
    noise_level = window_analyzer(tic)

    from pyms.BillerBiemann import num_ions_threshold
    filtered_peak_list = num_ions_threshold(peak_list, n=3, cutoff=noise_level)
    filtered_peak_list[:10]

Given a list of peaks, areas can be determined and added as follows:

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 2

    from pyms.Peak.Function import peak_sum_area
    for peak in peak_list:
        area = peak_sum_area(im, peak)
        peak.area = area
