Baseline Correction
===================

Baseline distortion originating from instrument imperfections and
experimental setup is often observed in mass spectrometry data, and
off-line baseline correction is often an important step in data
pre-processing. There are many approaches for baseline correction. One
advanced approach is based on the top-hat transform developed in mathematical morphology [1]_, and used extensively in digital image
processing for tasks such as image enhancement. Top-hat baseline
correction was previously applied in proteomics based mass spectrometry [2]_.
PyMS currently implements only the top-hat baseline corrector, using the
SciPy package ``ndimage``.

Application of the top-hat baseline corrector requires the size of the
structural element to be specified. The structural element needs to be
larger than the features one wants to retain in the spectrum after the
top-hat transform. In the example below, the top-hat baseline corrector
is applied to the TIC of the data set ``gc01_0812_066.cdf``, with the
structural element of 1.5 minutes:

The purpose of noise smoothing is to remove high-frequency noise from
data, and thereby increase the contribution of the signal relative to
the contribution of the noise.

First, setup the paths to the datafiles and the output directory, then
import ANDI_reader, savitzky_golay and tophat.

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 1

    import pathlib
    data_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve().parent.parent / "pyms-data"
    # Change this if the data files are stored in a different location

    output_directory = pathlib.Path(".").resolve() / "output"

    from pyms.GCMS.IO.ANDI import ANDI_reader
    from pyms.Noise.SavitzkyGolay import savitzky_golay
    from pyms.TopHat import tophat

Read the raw data files and extract the TIC.

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 2

    andi_file = data_directory / "gc01_0812_066.cdf"
    data = ANDI_reader(andi_file)
    tic = data.tic


.. parsed-literal::

     -> Reading netCDF file '/home/vagrant/PyMassSpec/pyms-data/gc01_0812_066.cdf'


Perform Savitzky-Golay smoothing

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 3

    tic1 = savitzky_golay(tic)

Perform Tophat baseline correction

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 4

    tic2 = tophat(tic1, struct="1.5m")

Save the output to disk

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 5

    tic.write(output_directory / "baseline_correction_tic.dat",minutes=True)
    tic1.write(output_directory / "baseline_correction_tic_smooth.dat",minutes=True)
    tic2.write(output_directory / "baseline_correction_tic_smooth_bc.dat",minutes=True)

Tophat Baseline correction on an Intensity Matrix object
--------------------------------------------------------

The :meth:`tophat() <pyms.TopHat.tophat>` function acts on a single :class:`~pyms.IonChromatogram.IonChromatogram`. To
perform baseline correction on an :class:`~pyms.IntensityMatrix.IntensityMatrix` object (i.e.Â on
all ``Ion Chromatograms``) the :meth:`tophat_im() <pyms.TopHat.tophat_im>` function may be used.

Using the same value for ``struct`` as above, :meth:`tophat_im() <pyms.TopHat.tophat_im>` is used as
follows:

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 6

    from pyms.TopHat import tophat_im
    from pyms.IntensityMatrix import build_intensity_matrix
    im = build_intensity_matrix(data)
    im_base_corr = tophat_im(im, struct="1.5m")

Write the IC for mass 73 to disk for both the original and smoothed
:class:`~pyms.IntensityMatrix.IntensityMatrix`:

.. nbinput:: ipython3
    :execution-count: 7

    ic = im.get_ic_at_index(73)
    ic_base_corr = im_base_corr.get_ic_at_index(73)

    ic.write(output_directory/"baseline_correction_ic.dat",minutes=True)
    ic_base_corr.write(output_directory/"baseline_correction_ic_base_corr.dat",minutes=True)
